# Elemental-Cards
Just a VERY simple game im working on, to learn programing with python.

This is my first ever program

Feel free to leave me suggestions or ideas, to make it more fun or advanced

And don't forget to give me feedback on it

ps: also i made it so you can use shortcuts like,"p" or "3" instead of "plant"!

Enjoy
