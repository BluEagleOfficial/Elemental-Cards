Here are the patch notes:
_________________________
 Version 0.0.1 alpha
 -the game is not lowercase sensitive anymore
 -if you chose something else it no longer shows an error
 
 Version 0.0.2 alpha
 -[big change] You can now REPLAY the game WITHOUT reopening the file!
 -The program closes itself if you say "no",when it asks you if you want to play again
 -[known bug] Sometimes it says that the input is invalid even tho it is correct (i don't know what causes it,but it will be fixed in the next version)
 -[small tip] you can just press enter to skip the instructions
